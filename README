= TGCPP =

A humble CPP port of TuxGuitar ( http://tuxguitar.herac.com.ar/ ), 1.1 maybe...
Only gtp and Song Model were ported.

License: GNU LGPL ( See http://tuxguitar.herac.com.ar/license.html )
Since most Java codes were copied & pasted, I decided to set same license, LGPL.

It uses memory pool, named DAS (dump allocation system) to make memory alloc/dealloc simple.
You may want to redesign it :)
